How do I approach designing software?
I start by reading what is desired from me, and see what is more important. Some of the new design features I learned were how to add 3D shapes, how to apply textures, colors and shedding. I also learned how to

Added lighting, and included features such as mouse control and keys. 

Adding keys and other user control features was a good thing to learn when working on this project. User input is very important when designing software. If I ever get a job in game development, such new kills

Will come in handily. 



How do I approach developing programs?

The approach I used was doing everything step by step. I work on the shapes meshes first, the coloring or textures second, and the shaden last. 

I deployed iteration. Every time I add something, I re-run the program to see if it was added successfully. This helps me to catch mistakes early and quickly fix them. 



How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?



 I learned so much from computational graphics and visualizations during my education. I have learned so much about coding, graphics and web and program features. 

 Learning more about them will greatly improve my future education. 

 What I have learned and will learn will not just help with my future education but my planned career path. Learning how to control graphics, and how to add program features, will make me 

 More suited for a greater range of careers. Animation, game graphics, movie production, web design. What I learned will help me in such professions.
